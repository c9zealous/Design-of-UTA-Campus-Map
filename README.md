# Design-of-UTA-Campus-Map
This project aims at modelling The University of Texas at Arlington campus map, the entire design and modelling has been done by using keyhole markup language files (KML) and converted into shape files and is studied in detail. The campus map covers entire UTA campus including structures like academic buildings, playgrounds, parking lots, administrative buildings, residence halls, on-campus/off-campus apartments. The entire system is built on top of QGIS interface, Google Earth, and Python programming language. The map is represented using three geometric representations in QGIS points, lines and polygons. Alongside map visualization, features like shortest walking path (between two points) calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm, nearest neighbour network analysis has been implemented using Python.
